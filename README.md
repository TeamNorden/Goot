## How do I make a bot?

**Step 1:** Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and make a new application.

![make app](https://github.com/scalgoon/Goot/blob/main/Images/Make-app.jpg?raw=true)

**Step 2:** Turn that application into a Discord Bot

![make bot](https://github.com/scalgoon/Goot/blob/main/Images/Build-bot.jpg?raw=true)

**Step 3:** Copy and paste the Bot's token into your code editor. This will allow you to connect your code to the bot.
